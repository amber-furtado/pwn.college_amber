# Challenge Name
More catting practice

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gVlywqGPOi3-ZCuXcAXld8BWfFo.QXwITO0wyM5EzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by 
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it 
in the file /usr/share/enchant-2/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into 
that directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/share/enchant-2/flag
pwn.college{gVlywqGPOi3-ZCuXcAXld8BWfFo.QXwITO0wyM5EzNzEzW}
```
